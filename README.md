# Machine-Learning
This folder contains a collection of machine learning projects I worked on to enhance my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and clustering techniques. Below is a summary of the projects I completed:


| **Project**                          | **Objective**                                                            | **Techniques Used**                           | **Tools Used**              | **What I Learned**                                                                 | **Score/Outcome**                                   |
