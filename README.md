# Machine-Learning
This folder contains a collection of machine learning projects I worked on to enhance my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and clustering techniques. Below is a summary of the projects I completed:


| **Project**                          | **Objective**                                                            | **Techniques Used**                           | **Tools Used**              | **What I Learned**                                                                 | **Score/Outcome**                                   |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| [**Mall Customer Segmentation**](https://github.com/AishuHaran/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Mall%20Customer%20Segmentation%20Analysis%20Project.ipynb)       | Segment customers based on spending habits and demographics.             | K-Means Clustering                            | Python, Scikit-Learn         | Learned how to segment customers into distinct groups using unsupervised learning | Identified actionable insights into customer behavior. <br>  **Cluster 0** (Niche Group, Budget-conscious consumers). <br>   **Cluster 1** (Middle Income, Largest group with balanced income and spending). <br>  **Cluster 2** (Affluent, but moderate spending). <br> **Davies-Bouldin Score:** 0.577 (indicates a good clustering result). |
| [**Breast Cancer Detection**](https://github.com/AishuHaran/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Breast_Cancer_Detection%20(2).ipynb)  | Predict the presence of breast cancer based on diagnostic features.      | Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Tree, Random Tree | Python, Scikit-Learn         | Gained insights into model performance and classification metrics.               | **Logistic Regression:** 96.49% accuracy, highly reliable in predicting benign and malignant cases, but slightly biased toward predicting benign cases. <br> **k-NN:** 94.74% accuracy, with a few misclassifications, including missed malignant tumors.<br> **Decision Tree:** Stable performance with overfitting in complex models; best results with max_depth=2.<br> **Random Tree:** 96% accuracy, strong precision and recall, especially for malignant tumors. |
| [**House Pricing Prediction**](https://github.com/AishuHaran/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Predicting_Housing_Prices%20(2).ipynb)         | Predict house prices based on features like location, size, and condition. | Linear Regression                            | Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas | Developed skills in regression models and handling real estate data.              | Reasonable training accuracy (R2: 0.770), but some error in test set predictions (R2: 0.579). |
| [**Diabetes Prediction**](https://github.com/AishuHaran/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Diabetes%20Prediction.ipynb)              | Identify diabetes likelihood based on health metrics.                    | K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification      | Python, Scikit-Learn         | Improved model accuracy by optimizing parameters and feature engineering.          | 81.82% accuracy with balanced identification of diabetic and non-diabetic cases. |
| **Credit Card Customer Segmentation**| Group credit card customers based on spending patterns.                  | K-Means Clustering                            | Python, Scikit-Learn, Pandas | Learned customer segmentation and profiling based on spending behavior.           | Identified distinct customer groups with valuable insights for targeted marketing. |
